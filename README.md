# Counter_Mashine
Enter a complicated operation (like factorial or calculating a power) and see the execution of it in a couter mashine.
The program converts an operation or list of operations (eg list[[1]] = list[[2]]!) into a list of counter machine commands. These commands can then be executed to see the calculation of the counter machine step by step (with a  0.05s pause between each step). Already calculating 6! takes sevaral minutes, since the counter machine is quite limited in what it can do.

I also uploaded the PDF of the code, but the nice thing about this program is seeing the counter machine in action with the "Dynamic" command.
